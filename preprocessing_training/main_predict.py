'''Wichtig: Bevor dieses Skript ausgef√ºhrt werden kann, muss sichergestellt werden, dass beim Preprocessing der 
Trainingsdaten der Vectorizer gespeichert wurde. Die Prediction funktioniert nur, wenn derselbe Vectorizer wie beim 
Training genutzt wird. Also unbedingt beim Training auf das setzen von save_vectorizer=True achten!'''
